## Fine-Tuning with Gemini (Work in Progress)

### Sample GitHub submodule for configuring a Model

This module provides a framework for fine-tuning Gemini models for specific customer needs. It's currently under development, as the Gemini model tuning API might not be fully functional yet.

**What We're Waiting On:**

* **Official Documentation:** We're awaiting the release of complete documentation for the Gemini model tuning API. This will provide details on API calls, code examples, and best practices for fine-tuning.

For now tune model using AI Studio

Then configure in ai_configurator.py to use that tuned model.

**What You Can Do Today:**

1. **Prepare Your Data:** Start collecting and anonymizing data specific to your customer's product or domain. This data will be crucial for training the fine-tuned model later. Consider techniques like masking names, usernames, emails, and other sensitive information while preserving data integrity. Refer to best practices for data anonymization to ensure responsible handling.
2. **Review Configuration (config.py):** Familiarize yourself with the configuration options in `config.py`. You can use environment variables or a YAML/JSON configuration file to set parameters like base model selection, epochs, and learning rate (these will be replaced with actual options from the Gemini API documentation once available).
3. **Explore Alternative Approaches:** If fine-tuning with the Gemini API isn't readily available, consider:
    * **Prompt-Based Customization:** If Gemini supports fine-tuning through prompts, craft prompts that incorporate data or keywords specific to the customer's needs.

**How to Implement Today's Workflow:**

1. Install required libraries (`pandas` for data manipulation in this example).
2. Create and anonymize your customer's training data using `data_prep.py` (replace the placeholder anonymization logic with your specific implementation).
3. Configure `config.py` with appropriate settings for your project (placeholders will be replaced with actual options from the Gemini API documentation when available).
